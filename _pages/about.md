Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is William Babincsak and I am a first year PhD Student in Robotics Engineering at WPI and a Draper Scholar. I work with both Professor [Nitin Sanket](https://nitinjsanket.github.io/) in the [PeAR Lab](https://pear.wpi.edu/) and Professor [Carlo Pinciroli](https://carlo.pinciroli.net/) in the [NEST Lab](https://www.nestlab.net/). I have previously worked in the NEST Lab during my Bachelors and Masters degrees, where I studied bio-inspired optimization for multi-robot task allocation. My PhD work will lie at the intersection of swarm robotics, aerial robotics, and computer vision, where I am interested in applications relevent to national security and climate change.
